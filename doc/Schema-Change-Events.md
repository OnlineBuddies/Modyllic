This is a proposal and has not been implemented anywhere.  This is intended
to allow the tool to handle more complicated schema changes, for instance,
moving a column from one table to another without losing data.

These are conceptually similar to DDL triggers, but these are of course,
only run by sqldiff or migrate and not on general changes to the
database.  They also insist on greater filtering then, for instance,
Oracle's DDL triggers.

    TRIGGER {BEFORE|AFTER} {CREATE|DROP} kind { table | proc | table.{column|index} }
    BEGIN
      -- SQL
    END

    kind is {TABLE | COLUMN | INDEX | PROC | FUNC | PROCEDURE | FUNCTION}
           PROC, FUNC and FUNCTION are all aliases for PROCEDURE

For example:

    DELIMITER ||
    CREATE TABLE foo ( id INT SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, bar INT, baz CHAR(20) )
    ||

Later the schema is changed to:

    DELIMITER ||
    CREATE TABLE foo ( id INT SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, baz CHAR(20) )
    ||
    CREATE TABLE bar ( id INT SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, bar INT )
    ||
    TRIGGER BEFORE DROP COLUMN foo.bar
    BEGIN
        CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE bar_backup AS SELECT id,bar FROM foo;
    END
    ||
    TRIGGER AFTER ADD TABLE bar
    BEGIN
        INSERT INTO bar SELECT id,bar FROM bar_backup;
    END
    ||

And the migrate script would generate:

    DELIMITER ||
    DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS migrate_before()
    ||
    CREATE PROCEDURE migrate_before()
    MODIFIES SQL
    BEGIN
        CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE bar_backup AS SELECT id,bar FROM foo;
    END
    ||
    DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS migrate_after()
    ||
    CREATE PROCEDURE migrate_after()
    MODIFIES SQL
    BEGIN
        INSERT INTO bar SELECT id,bar FROM bar_backup;
    END
    ||
    CALL migrate_before()
    ||
    CREATE TABLE bar (
        id INT SERIAL,
        bar INT,
        PRIMARY KEY (id)
    ) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=1 CHARACTER SET=utf8
    ||
    ALTER TABLE foo DROP bar
    ||
    CALL migrate_after()
    ||
    DROP PROCEDURE migrate_before
    ||
    DROP PROCEDURE migrate_after
    ||
