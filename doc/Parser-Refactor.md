I'm thinking it would be useful to decouple the parser and the schema
objects.  Have the parser emit a series of simple schema mutation commands
(as an array of structured data) that is then applied to a schema object. 
This would grant a number of advantages:

* Simplify the parser as it will no longer need to worry about schema state.
* Improved serialization targetâ€“ a JSON encoded version of this array.
* Separation will make it simpler to make the parser multidialect.
